      <h2 class="intro-title">Welcome to the Tipsy Vinyl!</h2>
      <p class="intro-text">
        You can call me Nuno, I'm a music enthusiast and I will be your bartender tonight.
      </p> 

      <p class="intro-text">
        This is something I've been meaning to create for a long time now, a place ( in this case, a bar)
        I can "store" my musical opinions and favorite albums in, all while sharing it with whoever finds this. I decided to choose a bar
        for this as, number 1, done right, it can exude an air of cozyness from it, and number 2, me likes tha alcohol.
      </p>

       <p class="intro-text">
        A year and a half ago
        now, I quit my job of 5 years, and I spent the remainder of that entire year searching for new opportunities, without any luck. I was extremely
        depressed, more than I had ever been in my life, and in the process of that, I found this album, and when I listened to it, in its
        entirety... It changed my life. I had finally found what moved me, more than any other movie, or book, or TV show I had ever read or watched.
        </p>
      <p class="intro-text">
        It changed my perspective on life, on priorities, on what it means to live on this earth with purpose. And I fail, as we all do, I still fail.
        But this became a guideline to how I wanted to live for the remainder of my time here. I'll... Eventually talk about this album. So, yeah,
        this is what I found on my journey of self-discovery and learning through music so far.
      </p>

      <p class="intro-text">
        Fair warning, I cuss a lot, in writing and in real life.
        I also like to talk about whatever I want, even some topics people may find offensive, so if that's ok with you, great! Stick around for some drinks,
        if not, no worries, there's better bars down the street.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-text">
        Enjoy!

          </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="post-text">
            Oh, man, I get to talk about Kendrick again, yay. (Clearly not a fan.)
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            This is only my second favorite album of his (I'll eventually talk about the first), and it is spectacular. I swear, I'm gonna try as much as I can to keep this post short. 
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            The concept and idea behind this album is that it all takes place on a typical Compton day, during Kendrick's younger years. It is a true story, and one he does not shy away from telling in its most raw and vicious form. Every track is a new chapter in that singular day, and the way Kendrick tells this story is movie-like. He describes the details of the events of that day so well you feel like you're there with him, and by describing these events, he is also describing what life was for him, and many others, growing up in one of the roughest cities in America, surrounded by poverty, gang violence, and death, every single day.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            Some of the tracks on here are an absolute masterclass in storytelling and tone-setting. "Sherane AKA Master Splinter's Daughter" is a perfect opening for what follows, "The Art of Peer Pressure" is, to my knowledge, one of the only songs that touches on that topic, in the context of gang affiliation, and "Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst" is one of the most, if not THE most introspective and beautiful song I've heard yet in my life. Kendrick can be quite religious when it comes to being hopeful, but hey, I'm not religious, and this song is next level greatness.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            So, I'd better shut up now (I'll reserve the monologue for my favorite album of his) and present you with a drink! This album has such a unique vibe to it, and since it transports you into this reality, I thought, there's two ways to go about this one, so I'm gonna include them both. It's either going to be a "Tommy's Margarita", with the tequila and the lime bringing those West Coast, sunny vibes, or, If you REALLY want to get into the vibe of the album, I could just sell you a 40.oz (Or a "Litrosa", for my Portuguese brothers out there), which is what Kendrick and his friends drink throughout the album. Unfiltered Sun.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            PS: The album cover is an actual photo that shows Kendrick as a child, with two of his uncles and his grandfather. One of the uncles is displaying a Crips gang sign on his hand, and on the table there is the aforementioned 40.oz, but also a baby bottle. A perfect example of the reality of growing up in Compton.

      <h2 class="post-title">The Divine Feminine - Mac Miller (2016)</h2>

      <div class="post-header">

        <div class="post-description">
         <ul> 
          <li class="post-bullet">
            Genres: Alternative Hip-Hop / Jazz Rap
          </li>

          <li class="post-bullet">
            Favorite Tracks: "Congratulations", "Dang!","Stay", "We", "God is Fair, Sexy Nasty"
          </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="post-text">
            As a bit of a breather after "Circles", I now present you "The Divine Feminine", my favorite album from Miller's discography. (I was saving this album for later, but eh... Valentine's is coming up, so fuck it.)
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            Back in 2016, Miller was dating singer/songwriter Ariana Grande and, since the only thing in his mind at the time was love, he decided to make an album out of it. It's a record that focuses a lot on the feeling in its many different forms, from the earliest of relationships to the oldest, and also talks about the process of men learning through women and their experiences in life.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            It's an album that is absolutely lost in reverence of love and the feminine form, and that includes sex (of course). This is a VERY horny album and It's not afraid to show it, from the lyrics, to the sampling, It wears its heart on its sleeve. Unlike Silk Sonic, in which the subject of sex is tackled with a layer of braggadociousness and cockyness, "The Divine Feminine" is horny in the context of intimacy rather than pride, It's the difference between having sex, and making love. Standouts include "Congratulations" for a perfect intro to what this album is about, "Stay" for some amazing trumpets and production and, I have to give credit to "God is Fair, Sexy Nasty" for its ending, where Miller's actual grandmother talks about how she met her husband and what their relationship was like. Truly delightful.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            For this one, I knew I wanted something more delicate, something that could feel young but also mature, so I decided to go for a "Rosé Spritz". Very easy to make, and to sip. A drink that encompasses what this album is about. A celebration of Love of all kinds, and Women in general. This one is for the ones in our lives.

          </ul>
          <p class="post-text">
            I think there's something to be said about the first album that I actively like from an artist being the posthumous one. Maybe It's the tone that it carries, the idea that these were the last tracks this person recorded before their end. I'm not sure. Fortunately, It's not the only album I like from Mac Miller, and it certainly is not my favorite, although I do want to talk about it.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            Mac Miller died of an overdose on September 7th, 2018, and left this album unfinished. And so, his friend and producer Jon Brion, decided to ultimately finish the album, in accordance with Miller's vision for it. It ended up being a very... Somber album, but also hopeful in some tracks. Some of Miller's lyrics in this album are very foreboding, and now knowing that he was suffering from depression and drug abuse... It ends up being a very sad album, but at the same time, a very peaceful album.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            I'm not a huge fan of Mac Miller's voice in general, It's very slow, very raspy, and It's just not for me. Except for the fact that, in this album, in this sound, I think It works wonders. As I've said before, It's a somber, but hopeful album. Cold and cozy at the same time. Think... The moment when you're finally at peace with dying. It's what this feels like. Standouts include "Blue World" for some amazing rythmic production, "I can See" for its crazy synths and "Woods" for... Vibes, I guess (This guy has no idea what the fuck he's talking about)
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            I didn't want to recommend something too strong or agressive for this one. As I've said, It's cozy facing the end. So I've decided to go for a "Hot Toddy". Something to warm you up for the last train home.

          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            I was debating If I should really talk about this guy or not, but at the end of the day, art is art, and I think it can be appreciated without actively liking or despising the artist. And honestly, after watching a documentary following his career, I mostly just feel sad for the schmuck, so...
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            Everyone knows who Kanye is, for better or worse, so let's focus on the album. "Yeezus" is absolutely insane, especially for the time It came out. Kanye woke up one day, sick of... Well, the world, really (a very Ye thing to do, nowadays), and decided to make an "industrial rap" album. To this day, I have not listened to anything like this album. Heavy, distorted, industrial riffs punctuate an angry discourse all along this record, making it sound like music made in a Y2K future. It's not meant for everyone, and It only gains from it.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            Kanye, as always, does the entire production process himself which, again, leads to some insane choices in some of the tracks on here, be them lyrics or sampling-wise. It does not have a cover, as evidenced by the Spotify embed at the end of the post and really, the entire album ends up being a statement. Standouts include "On Sight", with its distorted synths welcoming you to the chaos that is about to unfold, "Black Skinhead" for the absolutely amazing production and "I am a God", a track that could best be described as "THE quintessential megalomania song".
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            A drink for this album has to be bitter. It has to be raw and unfiltered. And since I coulnd't decide between two options, I'm putting them both here. It's either gonna be a "Dirty Vodka Martini", with extra brine, or just straight vodka, neat. The shittier the brand, the better.

      <h2 class="post-title">Dawn FM - The Weeknd (2022)</h2>

          <li class="post-bullet">

          </li>

            Favorite Tracks: "Take my Breath", "Sacrifice", "Out of Time", "Don't Break my Heart", "I Heard you're Married"
          </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="post-text">
            Let's start this one off by saying I'm not a fan of The Weeknd's... Demeanor in his discography. 
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            Every single song this guy makes is about one of three things: 1. Heartbreak, 2. Breaking Hearts, 3. Taboo Shit e.g. Having casual sex with a married woman. It's not the subject matter that I hate, hell, Silk Sonic navigates it pretty well, but The Weeknd has always felt... Kinda slimy to me, I don't know...
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            That being said... This album's pretty good. Every record has a concept that it adheres to, a feeling, a story, even a color. Some records take that concept and just gloss over it lightly in their tracks. Then, there's albums like this, where from start to finish, you are listening to a radio station aptly called "Dawn FM". The idea is that It's a radio station in purgatory, the last things you hear before you die, all hosted by Jim Carrey (No, I am not kidding, the man has an angelic voice)  
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            The soundscape this album brings is a return to 80s and 70s pop, sounds that are heavily inspired by Michael Jackson and Prince alike. A lot of synths and bass riffs complement The Weeknd's voice perfectly. Thematically, It's an album that mostly talks about the artist's personal insecurities and trust issues, mostly in regards to women in general. Not really something I can relate to on a personal level, but ultimately, can understand. Standouts include "Sacrifice", which is literally just MJ's "Thriller" if it was done today, "Out of Time" for the japanese city-pop inspired vibes and "I Heard you're Married" for two things: the impeccable 80s production and Lil Wayne's corny as fuck lyrics. "You like it dirty, and I'm Dirty Harry" makes me laugh every single time.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            Finding a good drink for this album also took a while, because It's not quite neon drink at a nightclub nor a fancy cup at an equally fancy bar. In the end, I decided a good kick is better than a bright appearance, so I went with a "French 75" cocktail. A classic appearance, nothing too colorful or fancy, but upon tasting, the kick of the gin and champagne with the sourness of the lemon sends you straight into your next life. A drink that could be served at a nightclub... But only if you let go of yourself.

          </ul>
          <p class="post-text">
            ...And this is the other Tyler album that I like (so far)
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            Do you see the genre tags I put up there? That shit is a straight up suggestion. This is an insane album to categorize, It's not exactly hip-hop, It's not exactly R&B, It is its own beast. An out of order audio journey of breakup, control issues and being a slave to an impossible feeling. Told through blaring synths, distorted vocals and a soundscape that sounds like if Tame Impala made an angry breakup rap album.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            It is considered, by many, to be Tyler's masterpiece album and even though I haven't listened to many others from him, IGOR feels special, definitive, like you're not gonna listen to anything exactly like this for years to come. It's very hard to write or talk about this album and describe its exact experience, but hey, I'm trying anyways. Favorite tracks are "IGOR'S THEME" for what is one of the best album openers I have ever heard in my life (no joke), "NEW MAGIC WAND" for an extremely aggressive track about wanting to kill a woman so he can be with her man (fun stuff, you know.) and "PUPPET", one of the only songs I've heard that speaks about the manipulation that can come with loving someone.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            I tried to base the choice of drink for this one based on a description of the album that I found: "Neon Heartbreak at 2 a.m., Looping Thoughts, Obsession, and Emotional Whiplash". There were a lot of cocktails or drinks I could've chosen, but I've decided to go with a "Boulevardier". A bitter-sweet drink that accompanies the feelings of falling in love with later resentment for that relationship. The sweet vermouth is nice, but the bourbon is always there to remind you that jealousy and anger can consume you, If you let it.

            So! Here's my opinion of modern rap and hip-hop: It fucking sucks. It's extremely pretentious and "braggadocious", the production is always the same, some bass with drums and a snare, with the same fucking rhythm every single goddamn time. There's no story, It's just the artist rapping about how he has a shit ton of money and "bitches" and does drugs and whatever else he does with his penis.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            That being said... I wanted to understand the appeal. What exactly is so interesting about this style of rap? Why do people like these modern day artists compared to the classics where they rapped about... Well, life, and how fucked up it is, really? I listened to a lot of artists trying to figure this out, and I just couldn't get it... Until I listened to Tyler.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            Tyler Okonma is... Compulsive, excentric and "in your face". He dresses how he likes, he acts how he likes and, with the money that he knows he has, he buys whatever he wants and shows it off. The key is that it doesn't come off as braggadocious, or pretentious. This is his own person, almost like he was born like this. He's extremely confident, but without being disrespectful, the type of person where If you tell him he sucks, he will quite literally challenge you to a Mario Kart race and probably beat you (this happened many times, no, I'm not kidding). He also, unlike most other rap artists out there, produces his own songs, which means that every track he makes sounds extremely experimental, like no other artist out there. And that was what made me start liking (some) modern rap.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            "Flower Boy" was the first album Tyler made where he decides to explore more of his feelings, and honestly, being a gay / bissexual black man must come with a lot of stories and experiences from his youth. His previous albums were aggressive statements, almost like Tyler rebelling against the world, or even himself, but this one is more introspective, more calm and accepting, having confidence in your own insecurities. There are moments of rage and frustration interspersed here and there, but It's mostly an album about acceptance of yourself, and nostalgia from better times. Standouts include "Where this Flower Blooms" for some amazing production and Frank Ocean vocals, "911 / Mr Lonely" for a double track feature about... Well, loneliness, and "November" where Tyler revels in his nostalgia of better times, lost in his own "November". 
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            As for a drink, I'd probably go with a "Paloma" for this one. A very colorful drink, fooling you into thinking it's sweet, only to taste the tequila and the lime on it. Confident on the outside, but hiding it's insecurities inside. One to be sipped slowly, on a late afternoon.

          <p class="post-text">
            Now that I've gotten your attention, Let's talk about this album. It is the first and only (so far) album by the artist duo Silk Sonic, comprised of Bruno Mars and Anderson. Paak. A bit of a joint venture into 70s Funk, Soul and R&B, this album absolutely gushes with sexuality, It's clearly a love letter to the genre and It's not afraid to show it.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            It's also composed perfectly as there is not one track that feels weaker or "out of left field", It all feels cohesive and sounds amazing, between Bruno's amazing vocals, and Paak's sublime production. Of note is that, yes, the album is sexy, but It's also funny, as both artists play on the stereotypes associated with this style of sound.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            Personal favorites include "Fly as Me" If you want a shot of confidence straight through your earholes, "After Last Night" for a track so sexually charged you'd swear your headphones are made out of velvet and "Smokin out the Window", a good pseudo-breakup song with some funny-ass lyrics.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            As for a drink, gotta go with an "Old Cuban". Rum and champagne for the class, mint and lime for an extra... Bite. Note: To drink this one, you MUST be wearing silk robes and always be near a bed/couch. I will stop with the sexual innuendos now.

          <p class="post-text">
            One reason I wanted to explore music and albums as whole was that I would speak with my wife and our friends about certain songs from our youth that I would just not remember or even know at all. This was mostly due to a bit of a tough childhood growing up. I'm not the type of person to say that "I suffered this" or "I suffered that". In my mind, everyone's had sucky moments when they were kids, in my case It was mostly a combination of my parents getting into some quite abrasive arguments, some even getting into physical violence, and me having a front seat to it all. It kind of... Made it so that I would close my mind off certain things, almost like my brain would quarantine some parts of my memories so I wouldn't get to experience them again.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            So what the fuck am I trying to say here, well, one day, I'm driving with my wife, and the radio is playing a song called "The Less I Know, The Better". Instantly, my wife starts singing along to it, and I'm taken aback, because It's a song she's heard from her youth... And I'm listening to it for the first time. And I love it. Did any of that make sense? No? I need another drink...
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            In reality, what I mean to say is that "Currents" by Tame Impala, who is ONE GUY, by the way, is absolutely great. An audio journey through failed relationships and new beginnings, only to realize we are doomed to make the same mistakes as before (I know, uplifting). It's an album that feels timeless in its sound, a lot of synths and a lot of drums makes a bartender happy, and if I ever get around to it, I'll add it to my collection. Standouts include the track "The Moment" for its infectious rhythm, "Yes, I'm Changing", a track perfectly made for the "couple's last slow dance ever", and the album ender "New Person, Same Old Mistakes", I think the title speaks for itself.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            After thinking for a while about what pairs well with this one, I've decided to go with a Negroni "Sbagliato", It's literally your standard Negroni cocktail but "Wrong", as the italian word implies, because its extra ingredient is italian prosecco, making it bubblier and sweeter to drink. It has the maturity of a normal Negroni, but with a hint of change, of youth, of pasts best forgotten.

          </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="post-text">
            Everything that could be said about this album has already been said a billion times. How It's rapper Kendrick Lamar's masterpiece, how It revolutionized the rap game, how It became the unofficial Black Lives Matter album. As for me... I like it. It's definitely not my favorite Kendrick project, I'll get to that eventually, but there is immense value in this album. It's just that, as a white man in his 30s, It's not an album that speaks to my experience in life. And that is more than ok.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            Because this album matters. It matters for every single black person living in the states or abroad. It speaks of life in America, of life constantly under the thumb of consumerist capitalism, of how difficult it is for a black person to succeed in life when they were often raised in a reality of survival and then bring that lifestyle with them, to a time where they're finally successful. It also speaks of racism, obviously, in its many, many forms, of injustice, of inequality, and about how fame and money, in the hands of a person who previously had nothing, can make them a monster of self-destruction.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            Tracks like "The Blacker the Berry" are emotion overflowing, anger spilling out in words of resentment and tiredness, while tracks like "Alright" are hopeful. Hopeful that better times are coming, that we will be alright. "u" is probably one of the most frustrating and relatable tracks I've ever heard, like looking into a reflection of your worst self. In the end, I like this album. The nuances of it all are too much to cover here, but hey... It's a classic for a reason.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            For this one, I'd probably have to recommend another Old Fashioned. Either that or just neat whiskey. It's too raw and real of an album for anything else. No frills.

          <ul>
          <li class="post-bullet">
            Genres: Alt Rock / Experimental Rock

             Favorite Tracks: "Bodysnatchers", "Nude", "Weird Fishes / Arpeggi", "Jigsaw Falling into Place"
          </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="post-text">
            So, I guess we can start with this one. The first album in my journey was actually not this one, it was "Moon Shaped Pool", also by Radiohead, I didn't much care for it, as it was a clear breakup album that came right after Thom Yorke had divorced from his wife of twelve years, and I just... Couldn't relate, I guess. The next one I heard was "Ok Computer", which was good, but in the end, It didn't quite capture my attention. At least, not like "In Rainbows" did.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            A friend of mine says this album is his favorite from the band and I can see why. I feel like It's the perfect blend of rock rawness in some tracks, while others offer more of the classic Yorke melancholia. It feels like an album that was made while everyone in the band was at their peak, and in accordance with what they wanted to do here. Favorites include "Bodysnatchers" for its grungy guitar, and "Nude" for one of the most beautiful and intimate songs I've ever listened to. Radiohead without being overly depressive or experimental.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            I'd say this one pairs well with an Old Fashioned. A warm, bittersweet drink that I think represents it well.
