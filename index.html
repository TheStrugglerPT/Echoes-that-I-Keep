      <p class="intro-text">
        You can call me Nuno, I'm a music enthusiast and I will be your bartender tonight.
      </p> 

      <p class="intro-text">
        This is something I've been meaning to create for a long time now, a place ( in this case, a bar)
        I can "store" my musical opinions and favorite albums in, all while sharing it with whoever finds this. I decided to choose a bar
        for this as, number 1, done right, it can exude an air of cozyness from it, and number 2, me likes tha alcohol.

        A year and a half ago
        now, I quit my job of 5 years, and I spent the remainder of that entire year searching for new opportunities, without any luck. I was extremely
        depressed, more than I had ever been in my life, and in the process of that, I found this album, and when I listened to it, in its
        entirety... It changed my life. I had finally found what moved me, more than any other movie, or book, or TV show I had ever read or watched.
        </p>
      <p class="intro-text">
        It changed my perspective on life, on priorities, on what it means to live on this earth with purpose. And I fail, as we all do, I still fail.
        But this became a guideline to how I wanted to live for the remainder of my time here. I'll... Eventually talk about this album. So, yeah,
        this is what I found on my journey of self-discovery and learning through music so far.
      </p>

      <p class="intro-text">
        Fair warning, I cuss a lot, in writing and in real life.
        I also like to talk about whatever I want, even some topics people may find offensive, so if that's ok with you, great! Stick around for some drinks,
        if not, no worries, there's better bars down the street.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-text">
        Enjoy!

          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            Now that I've gotten your attention, Let's talk about this album. It is the first and only (so far) album by the artist duo Silk Sonic, comprised of Bruno Mars and Anderson. Paak. A bit of a joint venture into 70s Funk, Soul and R&B, this album absolutely gushes with sexuality, It's clearly a love letter to the genre and It's not afraid to show it.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            It's also composed perfectly as there is not one track that feels weaker or "out of left field", It all feels cohesive and sounds amazing, between Bruno's amazing vocals, and Paak's sublime production. Of note is that, yes, the album is sexy, but It's also funny, as both artists play on the stereotypes associated with this style of sound.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            Personal favorites include "Fly as Me" If you want a shot of confidence straight through your earholes, "After Last Night" for a track so sexually charged you'd swear your headphones are made out of velvet and "Smokin out the Window", a good pseudo-breakup song with some funny-ass lyrics.

          <p class="post-text">
            One reason I wanted to explore music and albums as whole was that I would speak with my wife and our friends about certain songs from our youth that I would just not remember or even know at all. This was mostly due to a bit of a tough childhood growing up. I'm not the type of person to say that "I suffered this" or "I suffered that". In my mind, everyone's had sucky moments when they were kids, in my case It was mostly a combination of my parents getting into some quite abrasive arguments, some even getting into physical violence, and me having a front seat to it all. It kind of... Made it so that I would close my mind off certain things, almost like my brain would quarantine some parts of my memories so I wouldn't get to experience them again.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            So what the fuck am I trying to say here, well, one day, I'm driving with my wife, and the radio is playing a song called "The Less I Know, The Better". Instantly, my wife starts singing along to it, and I'm taken aback, because It's a song she's heard from her youth... And I'm listening to it for the first time. And I love it. Did any of that make sense? No? I need another drink...
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            In reality, what I mean to say is that "Currents" by Tame Impala, who is ONE GUY, by the way, is absolutely great. An audio journey through failed relationships and new beginnings, only to realize we are doomed to make the same mistakes as before (I know, uplifting). It's an album that feels timeless in its sound, a lot of synths and a lot of drums makes a bartender happy. Standouts include the opening track "Let It Happen" for its bombastic intro, the following track, "Nangs", which HAS to be listened to with headphones, and the album ender "New Person, Same Old Mistakes", I think the title speaks for itself.

      <div class="post-header">

        <div class="post-description">
          <ul>

          <li class="post-bullet">
            Genres: Experimental hip-hop / Jazz rap
          </li>

          <li class="post-bullet">
             Favorite Tracks: "Institutionalized" / "These Walls" / "Alright" / "How Much a Dollar Cost" / "The Blacker the Berry" / "You Ain't Gotta Lie (Momma said)"
          </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="post-text">
            Everything that could be said about this album has already been said a billion times. How It's rapper Kendrick Lamar's masterpiece, how It revolutionized the rap game, how It became the unofficial Black Lives Matter album. As for me... I like it. It's definitely not my favorite Kendrick project, I'll get to that eventually, but there is immense value in this album. It's just that, as a white man in his 30s, It's not an album that speaks to my experience in life. And that is more than ok.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            Because this album matters. It matters for every single black person living in the states or abroad. It speaks of life in America, of life constantly under the thumb of consumerist capitalism, of how difficult it is for a black person to succeed in life when they were often raised in a reality of survival and then bring that lifestyle with them, to a time where they're finally successful. It also speaks of racism, obviously, in its many, many forms, of injustice, of inequality, and about how fame and money, in the hands of a person who previously had nothing, can make them a monster of self-destruction.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            Tracks like "The Blacker the Berry" are emotion overflowing, anger spilling out in words of resentment and tiredness, while tracks like "Alright" are hopeful. Hopeful that better times are coming, that we will be alright. "u" is probably one of the most frustrating and relatable tracks I've ever heard, like looking into a reflection of your worst self. In the end, I like this album. The nuances of it all are too much to cover here, but hey... It's a classic for a reason.

        <div class="post-description">
          <ul>
          <li class="post-bullet">
            Genres: Alt Rock / Experimental Rock

             Favorite Tracks: "Bodysnatchers", "Nude", "Weird Fishes / Arpeggi", "Jigsaw Falling into Place"

          </ul>
          <p class="post-text">
            So, I guess we can start with this one. The first album in my journey was actually not this one, it was "Moon Shaped Pool", also by Radiohead, I didn't much care for it, as it was a clear breakup album that came right after Thom Yorke had divorced from his wife of twelve years, and I just... Couldn't relate, I guess. The next one I heard was "Ok Computer", which was good, but in the end, It didn't quite capture my attention. At least, not like "In Rainbows" did.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            A friend of mine says this album is his favorite from the band and I can see why. I feel like It's the perfect blend of rock rawness in some tracks, while others offer more of the classic Yorke melancholia. It feels like an album that was made while everyone in the band was at their peak, and in accordance with what they wanted to do here. Favorites include "Bodysnatchers" for its grungy guitar, and "Nude" for one of the most beautiful and intimate songs I've ever listened to. Radiohead without being overly depressive or experimental.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            I'd say this one pairs well with an Old Fashioned. A warm, bittersweet drink that I think represents it well.
