        You can call me Nuno, I'm a music enthusiast and I will be your bartender tonight.

        This is something I've been meaning to create for a long time now, a place ( in this case, a bar)
        I can "store" my musical opinions and favorite albums in, all while sharing it with whoever finds this. I decided to choose a bar
        for this as, number 1, done right, it can exude an air of cozyness from it, and number 2, me likes tha alcohol.

        A year and a half ago
        now, I quit my job of 5 years, and I spent the remainder of that entire year searching for new opportunities, without any luck. I was extremely
        depressed, more than I had ever been in my life, and in the process of that, I found this album, and when I listened to it, in its
        entirety... It changed my life. I had finally found what moved me, more than any other movie, or book, or TV show I had ever read or watched.
        </p>
      <p class="intro-text">
        It changed my perspective on life, on priorities, on what it means to live on this earth with purpose. And I fail, as we all do, I still fail.
        But this became a guideline to how I wanted to live for the remainder of my time here. I'll... Eventually talk about this album. So, yeah,
        this is what I found on my journey of self-discovery and learning through music so far.
      </p>

      <p class="intro-text">
        Fair warning, I cuss a lot, in writing and in real life.
        I also like to talk about whatever I want, even some topics people may find offensive, so if that's ok with you, great! Stick around for some drinks,
        if not, no worries, there's better bars down the street.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-text">
        Enjoy!

          <p class="post-text">
            ...And this is the other Tyler album that I like (so far)
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            Do you see the genre tags I put up there? That shit is a straight up suggestion. This is an insane album to categorize, It's not exactly hip-hop, It's not exactly R&B, It is its own beast. An out of order audio journey of breakup, control issues and being a slave to an impossible feeling. Told through blaring synths, distorted vocals and a soundscape that sounds like if Tame Impala made an angry breakup rap album.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            It is considered, by many, to be Tyler's masterpiece album and even though I haven't listened to many others from him, IGOR feels special, definitive, like you're not gonna listen to anything exactly like this for years to come. It's very hard to write or talk about this album and describe its exact experience, but hey, I'm trying anyways. Favorite tracks are "IGOR'S THEME" for what is one of the best album openers I have ever heard in my life (no joke), "NEW MAGIC WAND" for an extremely aggressive track about wanting to kill a woman so he can be with her man (fun stuff, you know.) and "PUPPET", one of the only songs I've heard that speaks about the manipulation that can come with loving someone.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            I tried to base the choice of drink for this one based on a description of the album that I found: "Neon Heartbreak at 2 a.m., Looping Thoughts, Obsession, and Emotional Whiplash". There were a lot of cocktails or drinks I could've chosen, but I've decided to go with a "Boulevardier". A bitter-sweet drink that accompanies the feelings of falling in love with later resentment for that relationship. The sweet vermouth is nice, but the bourbon is always there to remind you that jealousy and anger can consume you, If you let it.

          <p class="post-text">
            So! Here's my opinion of modern rap and hip-hop: It fucking sucks. It's extremely pretentious and "braggadocious", the production is always the same, some bass with drums and a snare, with the same fucking rhythm every single goddamn time. There's no story, It's just the artist rapping about how he has a shit ton of money and "bitches" and does drugs and whatever else he does with his penis.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            That being said... I wanted to understand the appeal. What exactly is so interesting about this style of rap? Why do people like these modern day artists compared to the classics where they rapped about... Well, life, and how fucked up it is, really? I listened to a lot of artists trying to figure this out, and I just couldn't get it... Until I listened to Tyler.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            Tyler Okonma is... Compulsive, excentric and "in your face". He dresses how he likes, he acts how he likes and, with the money that he knows he has, he buys whatever he wants and shows it off. The key is that it doesn't come off as braggadocious, or pretentious. This is his own person, almost like he was born like this. He's extremely confident, but without being disrespectful, the type of person where If you tell him he sucks, he will quite literally challenge you to a Mario Kart race and probably beat you (this happened many times, no, I'm not kidding). He also, unlike most other rap artists out there, produces his own songs, which means that every track he makes sounds extremely experimental, like no other artist out there. And that was what made me start liking (some) modern rap.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            "Flower Boy" was the first album Tyler made where he decides to explore more of his feelings, and honestly, being a gay / bissexual black man must come with a lot of stories and experiences from his youth. His previous albums were aggressive statements, almost like Tyler rebelling against the world, or even himself, but this one is more introspective, more calm and accepting, having confidence in your own insecurities. There are moments of rage and frustration interspersed here and there, but It's mostly an album about acceptance of yourself, and nostalgia from better times. Standouts include "Where this Flower Blooms" for some amazing production and Frank Ocean vocals, "911 / Mr Lonely" for a double track feature about... Well, loneliness, and "November" where Tyler revels in his nostalgia of better times, lost in his own "November". 
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            As for a drink, I'd probably go with a "Paloma" for this one. A very colorful drink, fooling you into thinking it's sweet, only to taste the tequila and the lime on it. Confident on the outside, but hiding it's insecurities inside. One to be sipped slowly, on a late afternoon.

            SEX.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            Now that I've gotten your attention, Let's talk about this album. It is the first and only (so far) album by the artist duo Silk Sonic, comprised of Bruno Mars and Anderson. Paak. A bit of a joint venture into 70s Funk, Soul and R&B, this album absolutely gushes with sexuality, It's clearly a love letter to the genre and It's not afraid to show it.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            It's also composed perfectly as there is not one track that feels weaker or "out of left field", It all feels cohesive and sounds amazing, between Bruno's amazing vocals, and Paak's sublime production. Of note is that, yes, the album is sexy, but It's also funny, as both artists play on the stereotypes associated with this style of sound.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            Personal favorites include "Fly as Me" If you want a shot of confidence straight through your earholes, "After Last Night" for a track so sexually charged you'd swear your headphones are made out of velvet and "Smokin out the Window", a good pseudo-breakup song with some funny-ass lyrics.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            As for a drink, gotta go with an "Old Cuban". Rum and champagne for the class, mint and lime for an extra... Bite. Note: To drink this one, you MUST be wearing silk robes and always be near a bed/couch. I will stop with the sexual innuendos now.

          </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="post-text">
            One reason I wanted to explore music and albums as whole was that I would speak with my wife and our friends about certain songs from our youth that I would just not remember or even know at all. This was mostly due to a bit of a tough childhood growing up. I'm not the type of person to say that "I suffered this" or "I suffered that". In my mind, everyone's had sucky moments when they were kids, in my case It was mostly a combination of my parents getting into some quite abrasive arguments, some even getting into physical violence, and me having a front seat to it all. It kind of... Made it so that I would close my mind off certain things, almost like my brain would quarantine some parts of my memories so I wouldn't get to experience them again.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            So what the fuck am I trying to say here, well, one day, I'm driving with my wife, and the radio is playing a song called "The Less I Know, The Better". Instantly, my wife starts singing along to it, and I'm taken aback, because It's a song she's heard from her youth... And I'm listening to it for the first time. And I love it. Did any of that make sense? No? I need another drink...
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            In reality, what I mean to say is that "Currents" by Tame Impala, who is ONE GUY, by the way, is absolutely great. An audio journey through failed relationships and new beginnings, only to realize we are doomed to make the same mistakes as before (I know, uplifting). It's an album that feels timeless in its sound, a lot of synths and a lot of drums makes a bartender happy, and if I ever get around to it, I'll add it to my collection. Standouts include the track "The Moment" for its infectious rhythm, "Yes, I'm Changing", a track perfectly made for the "couple's last slow dance ever", and the album ender "New Person, Same Old Mistakes", I think the title speaks for itself.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            After thinking for a while about what pairs well with this one, I've decided to go with a Negroni "Sbagliato", It's literally your standard Negroni cocktail but "Wrong", as the italian word implies, because its extra ingredient is italian prosecco, making it bubblier and sweeter to drink. It has the maturity of a normal Negroni, but with a hint of change, of youth, of pasts best forgotten.

          </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="post-text">
            Everything that could be said about this album has already been said a billion times. How It's rapper Kendrick Lamar's masterpiece, how It revolutionized the rap game, how It became the unofficial Black Lives Matter album. As for me... I like it. It's definitely not my favorite Kendrick project, I'll get to that eventually, but there is immense value in this album. It's just that, as a white man in his 30s, It's not an album that speaks to my experience in life. And that is more than ok.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            Because this album matters. It matters for every single black person living in the states or abroad. It speaks of life in America, of life constantly under the thumb of consumerist capitalism, of how difficult it is for a black person to succeed in life when they were often raised in a reality of survival and then bring that lifestyle with them, to a time where they're finally successful. It also speaks of racism, obviously, in its many, many forms, of injustice, of inequality, and about how fame and money, in the hands of a person who previously had nothing, can make them a monster of self-destruction.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            Tracks like "The Blacker the Berry" are emotion overflowing, anger spilling out in words of resentment and tiredness, while tracks like "Alright" are hopeful. Hopeful that better times are coming, that we will be alright. "u" is probably one of the most frustrating and relatable tracks I've ever heard, like looking into a reflection of your worst self. In the end, I like this album. The nuances of it all are too much to cover here, but hey... It's a classic for a reason.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            For this one, I'd probably have to recommend another Old Fashioned. Either that or just neat whiskey. It's too raw and real of an album for anything else. No frills.

      <h2 class="post-title">In Rainbows - Radiohead (2007)</h2>

        <div class="post-description">
          <ul>
          <li class="post-bullet">
            Genres: Alt Rock / Experimental Rock

             Favorite Tracks: "Bodysnatchers", "Nude", "Weird Fishes / Arpeggi", "Jigsaw Falling into Place"
          </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="post-text">
            So, I guess we can start with this one. The first album in my journey was actually not this one, it was "Moon Shaped Pool", also by Radiohead, I didn't much care for it, as it was a clear breakup album that came right after Thom Yorke had divorced from his wife of twelve years, and I just... Couldn't relate, I guess. The next one I heard was "Ok Computer", which was good, but in the end, It didn't quite capture my attention. At least, not like "In Rainbows" did.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            A friend of mine says this album is his favorite from the band and I can see why. I feel like It's the perfect blend of rock rawness in some tracks, while others offer more of the classic Yorke melancholia. It feels like an album that was made while everyone in the band was at their peak, and in accordance with what they wanted to do here. Favorites include "Bodysnatchers" for its grungy guitar, and "Nude" for one of the most beautiful and intimate songs I've ever listened to. Radiohead without being overly depressive or experimental.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            I'd say this one pairs well with an Old Fashioned. A warm, bittersweet drink that I think represents it well.
